# Challenge 5

## Linked List

__Create two classes, LinkedList and Node. Using test-driven development, implement/test the following features:__

1.Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list<br>
2.Can properly insert into the linked list<br>
3.The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list<br>
4.Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list<br>
5.Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists<br>
6.Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist<br>
7.Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list<br>



## linked list insertion



### Adding methods for the Linked List class:

 1. append

 2. insert before

 3. insert after


 - add a node to the end of the linked list
 - add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
 - insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
 - insert a node before the first node of a linked list
 - insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
 - insert a node after the last node of the linked list



  



## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->


## Approach & Efficiency
  For each of the features/requirements, I started by making a test that would prove that functionality. From there, I updated the Node and LinkedList classes to create the actual functionality that I would then test. After doing this for all of the features, I wrote docstrings to explain the purpose of each function that I constructed.
