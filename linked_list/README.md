 # Challenge 5

 ## Linked List

__Create two classes, LinkedList and Node. Using test-driven development, implement/test the following features:__

1.Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
2.Can properly insert into the linked list
3.The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
4.Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
5.Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
6.Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
7.Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list



## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
  For each of the features/requirements, I started by making a test that would prove that functionality. From there, I updated the Node and LinkedList classes to create the actual functionality that I would then test. After doing this for all of the features, I wrote docstrings to explain the purpose of each function that I constructed.
## Solution
