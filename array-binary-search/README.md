# Array-Binary-Search

## Challenge 3
    Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array

## Approach & Efficiency
- We kept it simple by creating a function that takes in a two argument as list and specific integer . 
- We decided to use while loop determine the posistin of int in the list after making some conditions . 
- Big O was O(N) - grows linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
