Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
We tried to keep our code as simple as possible to the best performance by reducing space/Time complexity
so we end with the following

Big O:
1. Time complexity => O(N) 
2. Space complexity => O(N)
