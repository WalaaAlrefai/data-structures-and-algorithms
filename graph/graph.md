#  Graphs

## Language: `Python`
## Challenge Type: ` Code Challenge / New Implementation`


## Challenge Graphs

## [Code](graph.py)
## [tests](../tests/test_graph.py)


## Challenge

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
- add node 
- add edge
- get nodes
- get neighbors
- size

The code should do the next functionality:

1. Node can be successfully added to the graph
2. An edge can be successfully added to the graph
3. A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
4. All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
5. Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
6. The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
7. A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
8. An empty graph properly returns null


## Approach & Efficiency
- All the methods in the table below exist in the Graph class.

### Big O:
the following table will show Big(O) for each method

| **Method**    | **Time** | **Space** |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| add node      | O(1)     | O(1)      |
| add edge      | O(1)     | O(1)      |
| get nodes     | O(n)     | O(n)      |
| get neighbors | O(n)     | O(n)      |
| size          | O(n)     | O(n)      |
